Very "work in progress", but saves you a looot of hassle if you are on Windows / and don't want to manually install stuff and/or rely on ported binaries.

Not at all tested but we do it as we go!

To "install" the module copt the repo to a folder in your module path (`$env:PSModulePath -split ';'`);
